Luke Feedback - 2018-08-16
==========================

Stuff Luke asked/suggested/experienced
--------------------------------------

* Where's next beat?
* "Different lengths which is interesting" - 1st gen beats
* While creating new beat expected it to play and stop current beat playing
* Didn't notice track type synth right away
* Stop/Play for arrangement was confused as current beat play/stop
* Label arrangement view
* Good that voting goes to next beat automatically
* Looked below family tree for mating button, and then "new family"
* "Gets a lot better even by second gen"
* Tracks with 32 notes don't fit
* Lag before changes take effect
* "How do I get to the next beat easily? There should be a keyboard shortcut for that"
* Not obvious that you can edit the current beat's notes
* Add "scroll to zoom" message and/or some more obvious zoom controls
* Starting counting from 1 rather than 0 for generation/beatnum
* Don't know what Select button does
* Bug with selecting beats, seems to add beats to current gen before making new one? (Or the visualization broke maybe)
* Members had children which weren't selected while using select to mate
* Can't add track to currently playing beat
* Random arrangement broken
* Some beats got a NaN score, not very tasty
* Would be nice to see where it is in the beat while playing
* Not obvious that you can click old beats to play them
* Nice that you can click around while "playing" is enabled
* Alternates between chaos and order, doesn't feel like it's necessarily converging on something "good"
* "Seems like it would be a lot of fun in a group situation"
* Simpler interface would help make it seem like less of a toy
* UI should help focus, eg bring up just synth by itself while working on it
* Being able to click tree not obvious
* "Like it both on its own and potentially w ableton"
* "Some chords coming out were really cool (synth harmonies), might not have thought of on my own"
* "Accented notes" for velocity approximation for samples, eg just having 1 extra option instead of range of velocity
* Intuition as to add to arrangement would be to drag beat. (Would prob be cool to drag any 
  representation of it tbh, eg in the family tree)

Stuff Ian/John wanted/realized
------------------------------

* Choose the generation to start with when creating random arrangement
* Add templates/archs for random arrangement
* Add config options in general for random arrangement
* Group intstruments (eg, percussion vs melodic instruments vs synth, vs whatever)
* Specifying how often a sound fires instead of manually turning notes on/off would be great
* Add sticky options for modals
* Make modals disappear on clicking outside the panel
* Randomize should warn that it's killing the current arrangement
* Rearrange arrangement beats/add to arbitrary position
* Remove track?
* Improve synth UI
* Limit rating system? Stars to rate with?
* Normalize synth sound vs samples
* Indicator that everything in a generation has been scored
* Tempo problems mixing beats with different numbers of notes
* "Similarity matrix", cluster beats by similarities
* Export beat or arrangement as sound file would be amazing
* Add beat from graph, or add current beat to arrangement
