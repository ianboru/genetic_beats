Stuff Luke asked/suggested/experienced
--------------------------------------

John
----

* Select/generation logic
* "How do I get to the next beat easily? There should be a keyboard shortcut for that"
* Not obvious that you can edit the current beat's notes
* Add "scroll to zoom" message and/or some more obvious zoom controls
* Being able to click tree not obvious
* Not obvious that you can click old beats to play them
* Don't know what Select button does (rename "Select for Mating"?)
* Rearrange arrangement beats/add to arbitrary position (Would prob be cool to drag any
  representation of it tbh, eg in the family tree)
* Indicator that everything in a generation has been scored
* Starting counting from 1 rather than 0 for generation/beatnum

Ian
---

* Bug with selecting beats, seems to add beats to current gen before making new one? (Or the visualization broke maybe)
  Selecting beats from current + last generation and then mating will display the latest generation on the
  same level as the second-to-last generation
* Members had children which weren't selected while using select to mate
* Solo/Mute buttons for samples
* IAN: Normalize synth sound vs samples volume (so synth starts at 50 too)


Up For Grabs
------------

* Didn't notice track type synth right away
* Looked below family tree for mating button, and then "new family"
* Tracks with 32 notes don't fit
* Lag before changes take effect
* UI should help focus, eg bring up just synth by itself while working on it
* "Accented notes" for velocity approximation for samples, eg just having 1 extra option instead of range of velocity
    * Make it possible to add two of same sample for now?
* Choose the generation to start with when creating random arrangement
* Add templates/archs for random arrangement
* Add config options in general for random arrangement
* Specifying how often a sound fires instead of manually turning notes on/off would be great
* Add sticky options for modals
* Improve synth UI


Future potential
----------------
* Export beat or arrangement as sound file would be amazing
* "Seems like it would be a lot of fun in a group situation"
* "Similarity matrix", cluster beats by similarities
